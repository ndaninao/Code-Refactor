# Code-Refactor
This first assignment required basic understanding of HTML and CSS, plus HTML 5. Many changes were made by replacing <div> with more specific tags, such as <main>, <nav>, <article>, <section>, <header>, <footer>. 

The navigation tag allowed for the removal of <ul> and <li>, but an additional <id> tag was required to specify font color and stylization. 

Secondly, many attributes in CSS were duplicates and could be merged together by changing the different class names into one single name. Other attributes could simply be added in to other areas. 

Other changes included fixing a bug, aka broken link by adding an <id>. 

What more could have been done?
I attempted to add a @media screen for the Navigation Bar in order to make the navigation compatible on multiple platforms. As the material is new, as of today, and I had limited time... I was unsuccessful. I do hope to be able to accomplish this task in the near future.
